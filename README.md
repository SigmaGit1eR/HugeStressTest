Huge Stress Test - OpenGL GPU + CPU + RAM Load Generator
========================================================

Description
-----------
This application creates a fullscreen OpenGL window and performs heavy GPU, CPU, and RAM load simultaneously.
- GPU load is generated via a complex fragment shader with intensive calculations.
- CPU load runs in a separate thread, continuously performing floating-point math operations.
- RAM load runs in another thread, repeatedly allocating 10 MB memory blocks until memory exhaustion.

The app is intended for stress testing hardware and thermal throttling analysis.

Features
--------
- Fullscreen OpenGL 3.3 Core profile window
- GPU load generated by a custom GLSL shader running expensive loops
- Multithreaded CPU load with continuous math operations
- RAM load by progressive allocations until out-of-memory
- Clean shutdown when window is closed
- Error checking and logs for OpenGL shader compilation/linking failures
- Uses GLFW for window/context and input handling
- Uses GLEW for OpenGL function loading
- C++11 standard for threading and atomic operations

Requirements
------------
- Windows or Linux (GLFW and GLEW support)
- GPU supporting OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile
- C++11 compatible compiler
- Linked libraries:
  - glfw
  - glew
  - OpenGL (opengl32 on Windows, GL on Linux)
- Math functions from <cmath>

Controls
--------
- Close the window to exit the application and stop all stress tests

Build Instructions
------------------
Compile and link with glfw, glew, and OpenGL libraries.

Example with g++ on Linux:
g++ main.cpp -o HugeStressTest -lglfw -lGLEW -lGL -lpthread -std=c++11

On Windows, link with opengl32.lib, glfw3.lib, glew32.lib or glew32s.lib accordingly.

Notes
-----
- RAM stress thread may cause system instability if allowed to allocate all free memory.
- CPU and GPU loads are intense; monitor temperatures to avoid overheating.
- Modify the shader or thread workload for custom stress levels.
